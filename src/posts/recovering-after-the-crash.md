I’ve been doing some form of product design for the last 11 or so years, 10 of those being in a more professional capacity for various start ups. I thought when I started that I was going to be this amazing designer, doing a job I love for the rest of my working life. I’ve been feeling the effects of burnout for probably 4 years if I’m being totally honest with myself. I needed more time away. In those 10 years, the longest time-off I had was 3 weeks, and more recently a month before joining [Plain](https://plain.com). It’s not sustainable.

Product design was becoming just a job, not the "doing something I love every day" I thought it was going to be when I started. I’ve been asked by various employers over the years if I wanted to go into management and that’s really not something that resonates with me. Don’t get me wrong, I love teaching and mentoring people, but managing a team just ain’t it. I feel like the value I can bring to an organisation has always been hands-on, designing and building the product. That meant I’d been treading the IC (Individual Contributor) path more. When you’ve been an IC for 10 years, you sort of see the same stuff whatever you work on. It’s largely the same processes for solving problems, even in different verticals. I think I’ve found it hard to keep work interesting. Early in your career, you’re learning loads and at a really fast rate. Later on that learning speed slows down as you’re under more pressure to ship things. You lean on the things you know to get stuff done quickly. That’s why you’re compensated well, your value becomes more about solving problems fast.

Those pressures and repetition I think are the things that have contributed to my feeling of burnout. I was exhausted. Sure, each business has it’s own challenges, and I don’t want to give the impression that everywhere I’ve worked has been boring, because that’s not true. I’ve just stopped learning as much and as quickly. My interest in the field has waned. I need to reset.

Since October, I’ve been doing a lot more in the web3 space and it’s reignited that learning flame for me. I’ve released a project I’m truly proud of, and it’s been the catalyst I needed to take a break from traditional product design. I’m learning all these new things like new coding languages, governance, and economics. I’m filled with new ideas all the time, to the point where it’s probably really annoying for some of my new web3 developer friends.

My biggest hurdle since October has been time. I committed to starting at [Plain](https://plain.com) before I did my little project, and I was still really excited to join the team. I’ve worked with both the founders before, and they’re people I really respect and admire. The product is an interesting challenge, and I’ve had a lot of fun solving some of the problems, writing code, and revamping the design system slightly. However I couldn’t shake the feeling that Product Design may not be for me, at least not right now. I wanted to explore this new medium, make some art, and make new friends along the way.

So I’m taking a break. I’m not sure what the next few months look like but I’m fortunate enough to have a little runway where I can make this break possible. First I’m just going to take some time away from tech. I’ll probably be tweeting and tinkering with projects, but I also want to get back outside more. Maybe reinstate my camera from it’s current position as a glorified webcam, and actually go and take some photos. I want to paint. I want to draw. I just want to be creative for a bit. In a few months when I start to get worried about the finances, I’ll probably pick up some contract work. The important thing for me is that I get to choose how much I should be working. The last thing I want is to have a couple of months off and go back into something full-time, and be back here in 6 months time.

I do want to say thank you to [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattvagni) and [Simon](https://twitter.com/simonrohrbach) at [Plain](https://plain.com) though for being so understanding of my situation. They have a lot of stuff to build, and I’m not leaving at the best time for them, but they get it and could see the signs. If you’re a technically minded Product Designer (with a bit of coding experience) please reach out to me and I can put you in touch. They’re an awesome, intentionally small team, with some really cool challenges and ambitious goals.

If you’re not a designer, but are an organisation that’s looking for someone to help with design, consult about web3 stuff, or write some fun smart contracts, then reach out to me. Even if I won’t be ready to work on anything right now, I always appreciate meeting new people.

If you have questions about the feeling of burnout, or are feeling something similar, feel free to reach out. I’m going to have a lot of time on my hands for conversations and connections. I’m always more than happy to discuss things like this, and I hope sharing my experiences encourages others to look within themselves too.

Here’s to chilling the fuck out, and making some art!

Thanks for reading, Sam.
